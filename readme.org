#+STARTUP: showall
#+TITLE: Edit with emacs Everywhere
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

* Introduction

This module allows editing with Emacs anywhere in OS X.

See this demo: [[https://youtu.be/jYUKYpXL6rI]]

In any text field in any application, one can summon Emacs to edit text:

1. User is in a non-Emacs application, and presses the bound keys (see below).
2. Emacs opens a buffer for editing.
3. User edits buffer via Emacs.
4. User presses =C-c C-c=, sending the Emacs buffer back to the originating application window.

* Installation

** Hammerspoon

Install Hammerspoon, either from [their instructions](https://hammerspoon.org/#how-do-i-install-it) or via Homebrew (e.g., `brew install hammerspoon`).

Place this repository’s folder inside the =~/.hammerspoon/Spoons= directory such that you have the following:

#+begin_src sh
 ~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/editWithEmacs.spoon
#+end_src

Note, the =.spoon= extension is important.

Modify your =~/.hammerspoon/init.lua= and add:

#+begin_src lua
-- Optional configuration of beginEditShellCommand
spoon.editWithEmacs.openEditorShellCommand = "EDITOR -e '(hammerspoon-edit-begin)'"

hs.loadSpoon("editWithEmacs")
if spoon.editWithEmacs then
   local bindings = {
      edit_selection =  { {"alt"}, "1"},
      edit_all       = { {"alt"}, "2"}
   }   
   spoon.editWithEmacs:bindHotkeys(bindings)
end

#+end_src

** Emacs

Load the =hammerspoon.el= file in Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  ;; If the hammerspoon configuration is present, and so is this spoon, load it
  (if (file-readable-p "~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/editWithemacs.spoon/hammerspoon.el")
    (let ((load-path (cons "~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/editWithemacs.spoon" load-path )))
      (require 'hammerspoon)))
#+end_src

* Testing installation

To test if you Hammerspoon works from Emacs, call =hammerspoon-test= (e.g., =M-x hammerspoon-test=).

* How to use

With the above keybindings, when you press =Cmd= + =Alt= + =Ctrl= + =e=, Hammerspoon will copy the content of the current application’s focus, open an Emacs buffer, and paste those contents into the buffer.  You then edit the that Emacs buffer and press =C-c C-c= to send that back to the originating window.

If you press =Shift= + =Cmd= + =Alt= + =Ctrl= + =e=, Hammerspoon cuts the current selected text, and pastes that into the buffer.  When you finish editing, Hammerspoon will paste the content of the buffer; which will replace the selected text.

* Limitations

- This method is non-reentrant. This means you can only edit one field at a time. You do not need to send the text back to the text-field.
  You can use edit-with-emacs again without any undesirable effect.
- It is currently sending commands directly to emacs via the keyboard. Thus, emacs should be ready to accept commands
- If something goes wrong and the text does not appear, you can retrieve it from emacs. Switch to the _hs_edit buffer and you will see the text you were editing.
  This buffer will be reused
